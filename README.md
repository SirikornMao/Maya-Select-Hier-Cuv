This script is the first script I wrote. When I was rigging the character, 
I ran into the heirarchy selection problem where I had to keep the curves on the parent and group open so that I could click on each curve so that the animator could click on it with just one click. So I tried writing this script. 
I know it's not perfect enough to be used as a reference, but if anyone has an idea or wants to make this script more perfect, please feel free to do so.
